                  testing, all leading to software design and development. Our
                  key focus is building a new enterprise distributed platform
                  and new set of products, bringing innovation in the domain
                  that will work as an ecosystem of well connected and

                  more efficient, synergetic, fast and secure clinical trial
                  process.
